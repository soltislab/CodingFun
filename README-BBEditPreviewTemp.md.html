<h1>Coding Fun</h1>

<p>This has directions and some sample code for the Soltis Lab coding group.</p>

<h2>For Oct. 5:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Last week we wrote some code to calculate GC content. My Version of this is in the DNAcalc.py file.</li>
<li>This doesn't quite do what we want...Modify it to print out the %GC (ie. DNAseq.count(Base) when Base=G plus when Base=C divided by sequence length)</li>
<li>Currently this script uses a sequence hard coded on line 3 of the script. Let's modify this to read from a file and calculate %GC for each sequence in the file. For now, we will assume that the file has one sequence per line.</li>
<li>Let's use argparse to take the filename from the command line.
Here's an example:
``` 
import argparse
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add<em>argument("-i", help="input file")
parser.add</em>argument("-o", help="output file")</li>
</ol>

<p>args = parser.parse_args()</p>

<p>InFile = args.i
OutFile = args.o
```</p>

<ol>
<li>Let's use BioPython to read a fasta file and calculate %GC.
Here's an example:
<code>
IN=open(InFile, 'r')
for record in SeqIO.parse(IN, "fasta") :
for Base in ('A','G','T','C', 'N'):
    NumBase=record.seq.count(Base)
</code></li>
</ol>
